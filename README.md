# ABSTRACT

The aim of this project is to create simulation of process scheduling in Operating system (Round Robin and Shortest Job First) . The project provides a beautiful graphical interface for interaction between human and the system.

The main objective of the project is to visualise how processes are scheduled in an operating system in the form of computer graphics . The project shows how process are first in the ready queue(RAM) and then they are executed by CPU.

The process scheduling algorithms are not very intuitive. It sometimes becomes hard to visualise how processes are scheduled and executed. Thus the main interest of this project is to make learners get clear understanding of the process scheduling algorithms(Round Robin and Shortest Job First) .

The project has been built using OpenGL library.The demonstration of the process scheduling has been shown in the form of Gantt chart. Inaddition to Gantt chart average waiting time,Turnaround time is also printed on the terminal. 

# 1.1 Computer graphics 

Computer graphics are found in almost every industry; individuals in all demographic, geographic, racial, political, and religious groups benefit from them. When picking up a magazine or newspaper, watching television, going to the movies, or taking a drive down the street, images produced by computer graphics are seen.

# 1.2 OpenGL
OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists of about 150 distinct commands that you use to specify the objects and operations needed to produce interactive three-dimensional applications. OpenGL is designed as a streamlined, hardware-independent interface to be implemented on many different hardware platforms. To achieve these qualities, no commands for performing windowing tasks or obtaining user input are included in OpenGL
 
OpenGL is an actively developed API. New versions of the OpenGL specifications are regularly released by the Khronos Group, each of which extends the API to support various new features. The details of each version are decided by consensus between the Group's members, including graphics card manufacturers, operating system designers, and general technology companies such as Mozilla and Google.
